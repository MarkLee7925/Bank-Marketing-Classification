# Bank-Marketing-Classification

This classification project utilized several Machine Learning models to determine if a bank client has subscribed to a term deposit. The data used represents the results of a telemarketing campaign by a Portuguese banking institiution. Each model was optimized to achieve the best possible accuracy score.

## Dataset:

This project utilized the bank-additional-full.csv dataset retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing). This version closely resembles the data analyzed by [Moro et al., 2014] and contains 41188 samples and all 20 input features. This is located in the data folder.

More information about each feature can be found in the bank-additional-names.txt file in the data folder.

## Models:

The following Machine Learning models were implemented in this project:

- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Decision Tree Classification (DT)

## Results

The accuracy score of each model is presented below:

- LR: 90.945%
- DT: 91.392%
